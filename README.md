  So far everything works except the following:-

    NVIDIA® GeForce® 940MX 4GB GDDR5 (Disabled as cannot work on Mac OS)
    USB 2.0 Realtek CRW SD Card Reader (Detected but not working)
    Built-In Intel WLAN Card (Not supported by Mac OS)
    Headphone jack not working when fully inserted. Got some audio when halfway inserted.
